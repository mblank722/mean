<!-- Bug List:
The last character in the word doesn’t show up! The spaces in the words do not appear correctly, i.e., the cursor does not shift to the right when encountering a space, instead, lingering on the previous character.
Hints:
Slow the interval down non-breaking space
Note:  At this point, you're not expected to be able to create something like this from scratch, so don’t worry if the code seems daunting at first. By the end of the track, you will be able to build projects like this from scratch. -->
