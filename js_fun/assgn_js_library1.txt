Assignment I: JavaScript Library
Your own custom JavaScript Library!

Did you know that you actually know how to create your own custom JavaScript libraries like Underscore and jQuery?

//Can we make this into a method of an object?
function each(arr, callback) {
  // loop through the array
  for(var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    callback(arr[i]); // invoking the callback many times... delegation!
  }
}

To create your own custom JavaScript library, you will just add methods to a JS object! (Later on when we teach you about immediate functions you’ll see how to make this more robust to build libraries like jQuery!).

Let’s build a few methods of underscore!

var _ = {
   map: function() {
     //code here;
   },
   reduce: function() {
     // code here;
   },
   find: function() {
     // code here;
   },
   filter: function() {
     // code here;
   },
   reject: function() {
     // code here;
   }
 }
// you just created a library with 5 methods!
Copy
var evens = _.filter([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], function(num){ return num % 2 == 0; });
console.log(evens); // if things are working right, this will return [2,4,6].
Copy
Hints:

Look at _.filter when it is invoked.

How many arguments was _.filter passed? What are those arguments? If you had to classify them, what names would you give each of them? Given your answers (especially #3), place those names into your filter as parameters.
Use what you learned in the previous chapter about callbacks and delegation to complete the assignment.

One important concept that we want you to learn through this assignment is how to pass data to and from callbacks. You pass data to a callback with a parameter and you pass data from the callback back to the parent function with a return. While you are going through this assignment pay close attention to this relationship.

Each method’s functionality is described here: underscore.js.

Note that your method does not have to be as robust as underscore’s you just need to get the base functionality working. Therefore for most methods, you will only have the array and a callback as parameters and for the callback, you will pass in each element and potentially a “memo” also known as a “collector”
