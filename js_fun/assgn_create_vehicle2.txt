Assignment: Creating Objects II

Modify your VehicleConstructor (from earlier) to use this & new (and follow the JS conventions talked about in the previous chapters).

To recap, here were the requirements from Part I:

Create a vehicleConstructor that takes in the name, number of wheels, and number of passengers

Each vehicle should have a makeNoise method Using the constructor, create a Bike redefine the Bike’s makeNoise method to print “ring ring!”

Using the constructor, create a Sedan redefine the Sedan’s makeNoise method to print “Honk Honk!”

Using the constructor, create a Bus
Give the bus a pickUpPassengers method that takes in the number of passengers to pick up and adds them to the passenger count


Then make the following modifications:

Have the Vehicle constructor also take in a “speed”
Store the speed as an attribute
Create a private variable called distance_travelled that starts at 0

Create a private method called updateDistanceTravelled that increments distance traveled by speed

Add a method to the Vehicle called “move” that calls updateDistanceTravelled and then makeNoise

Add a method called checkMiles that console.logs the distance_travelled
Bonus: Use ES6 Class!

Note: Making truly (or almost truly) private vars using ES6 classes is rather advanced at this point in your JS development career.
Modify the Vehicle constructor to use this & new as well as the JS conventions taught in the previous chapters

Make the advanced modifications to the Vehicle constructor and then upload your code below
