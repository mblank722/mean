Assignment: Creating Objects III
Modify your Vehicle Class to take advantage of Prototypes!

To recap, here is what we did in Parts I & II:

Create a VehicleConstructor that takes in the name, number of wheels, and number of passengers

Each vehicle should:
 have a makeNoise methodUsing the constructor,
 create a Bikeredefine the Bike’s makeNoise method to print “ring ring!”

 Using the constructor, create a Sedan:
 redefine the Sedan’s makeNoise method to print “Honk Honk!”
 Using the constructor, create a Bus
 Give the bus a pickUpPassengers method that takes in the number of passengers to pick up and adds them to the passenger count

Then make the following modifications:

Have the Vehicle constructor also take in a “speed”
Store the speed as an attribute
Create a private variable called distance_travelled that starts at 0
Create a private method called updateDistanceTravelled that increments distance traveled by speed
Add a method to the Vehicle called “move” that calls updateDistanceTravelled and then makeNoiseAdd a method called checkMiles that console.logs the distance_travelled

==================================================
Now modify your code to use Prototype and the recommended way of OOP we showed in the previous chapter.

You may have to change some private variables/methods to attributes to make all of the functionality work.

Then make the following additions:

Have each vehicle generate a random VIN number (study Math.random & Math.floor). Don’t worry about potential duplicates for now.
